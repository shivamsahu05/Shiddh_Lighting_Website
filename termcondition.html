            <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
            <p>Welcome to SHIDDH Lighting Industries. By accessing or using our website, you agree to comply with and be bound by the following terms and conditions:</p>

            <h3>1. Policies</h3>
            
            <h4>1. Opened Bulbs Warranty Policy</h4>
            <p>We generally provide a 1-year warranty for LED bulbs. This warranty only covers the condition of the bulb when it is still in its original packaging and unused. If the bulb is opened or damaged in any way before use or inspection, the warranty becomes void. In other words, if the bulb is removed from its packaging and used, repaired, or inspected internally, any warranty claims will not be accepted. The warranty is only valid if the bulb remains in its packaging and is undamaged.</p>

            <h4>2. Credit Sales Policy</h4>
            <p>With immediate effect, all credit sales have been suspended. Future transactions will only be conducted on a cash or advance payment basis. Goods will not be provided on credit under any circumstances.</p>

            <h4>3. Warranty Replacement Policy</h4>
            <p>Bulbs provided under warranty will be replaced with the same type of bulb. If you prefer a refund instead of a replacement, the refund will be 50% of the current price of the bulb. Please note that refunds will only be issued in accordance with this policy.</p>

            <h4>4. Replacement of Non-Warranty Bulbs</h4>
            <p>If you provide a warranty on non-warranty bulbs sold and replace them within a year for any reason, the replacement bulb must be of the SHIDDH brand. Please note that Gamma DOB 7333 bulbs are not eligible for warranty or guarantee. In such cases, non-warranty bulbs will be accepted at 70% of the current price.</p>
